# OpenVR Volume Control

As of this writing, changing the volume from within VR involves pointing at a 2D volume control. I found that frustrating and difficult to do precisely, as I often wanted the volume at or near the lowest level, so this allows adjusting the volume by dragging a giant virtual slider with haptic feedback.

The audio gear on the table is from a paid asset package, and will not be included in this repository. The utility will still work if you don't have it - the gear is entirely cosmetic.
